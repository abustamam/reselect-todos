## Reselect Todos

Repository for Reacto Meetup on Dec 7. Should be done by Nov 30.

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SouQYuY_Y8X8RSw_bWdgoBIS6AKfd0F7MSOpIkgC7Jc/edit?usp=sharing) for PowerPoint slides (using Google Slides, nothing to download)

### Quick start:

```
git clone https://github.com/abustamam/reselect-todos.git
cd reselect-todos
npm i
npm start
```

### Branches
- master: the original ShoppingMVC
- with-reselect: maps all mapStateToProps to use reselect, moves some logic out of components into Redux
- ppt: some random code snippets I wrote for the ppt, not really useful

### Run tests
```
npm run test
```
